# PYTHON_DAY_6

Assignment:

Consider the following function:

def div(a, b):
  return a // b
Where We have to Write a decorator, mod_div() that will add a feature to the above function which will make sure that numerator will be always greater than the denominator.

Example:

If a = 8 & b = 3, then result will be 2.

If a = 3 & b = 8, then result should be also 2.



Note: We are not allowed to change the div() function definition
